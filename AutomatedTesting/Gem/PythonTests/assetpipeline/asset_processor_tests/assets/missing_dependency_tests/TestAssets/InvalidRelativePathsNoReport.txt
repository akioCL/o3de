Paths that will never work:
Path to file that does not exist
Some/Made/Up/Path.txt

Paths that are not yet handled, but we may handle in the future:
Path without an extension
textures/_dev_Purple
Absolute path
i:\p4\lyengine\branches\Helios\dev\AutomatedTesting\TestAssets\LooksLikeUUID.txt
Source path that doesn't start at a scan folder root.
AutomatedTesting\Textures\_dev_Red.tif
Cache file without a path.
_dev_Red.dds

These tests are mostly done with files that have a different extension between source and product.
The source scan is done first, and will catch files in the source path.
Product path searching is resolved using "endsWith" logic.

Back slashes
testassets\b.auto_test_asset
Double back slashes

Some files have multiple extensions, this verifies that won't trip up the scanner.
